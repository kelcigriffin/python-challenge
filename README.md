In PyBank, to find my average change rounded to 2 decimal places (to denote a dollar amount), I referred to this link:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-round-to-2-decimal-places-in-python/

I received help from Dwight in writing the following parts of PyBank and PyPoll:  
  PyBank:
    greatest increase/decrease in profits
    finding profit change
  PyPoll:
    enumeration
    the code in line 81
