# python-challenge

For week 3's homework, I referenced previous lessons, and had a meeting with Dwight. I also Googled how to round decimal places and how to print string values on new lines.

# Code Sources and Locations

In PyBank, to find my average change rounded to 2 decimal places (to denote a dollar amount), I referred to this link:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-round-to-2-decimal-places-in-python/

For both PyBank and PyPoll, I used the following information to show me how to print on a new line:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/print-newline-in-python/#:~:text=Using%20the%20escape%20character%20%5Cn,use%20a%20different%20escape%20sequence.

I received help from Dwight in writing the following parts of PyBank and PyPoll:

  PyBank:
    
    greatest increase/decrease in profits
    
    finding profit change
  
  PyPoll:
    
    enumeration
    
    the code in line 81
